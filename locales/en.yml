      Scan this code with the ChastiKey App like loading a lock (within the next 5 minutes), this will verify your Discord Account to ChastiKey.
      If your ChastiKey account is new in the last 15-30 minutes, it may take this long for Kiera to receive all the required data.
    CkeckYourDMs: Check your DMs from Kiera for further instructions.
    FastForward: Your account has been verified! Some data may still take **up to 15 minutes** to be cached and fully accessable.
    PreviouslyCompleted: Your account has already been verified! If there are any issues with this please reachout to `emma#1366`
    VerifyRequired: |-
      This command requires your account be verified with ChastiKey using the following command: 
      `!ck verify`

      If you just did this in the last 15 minutes or less, you can speed up some of the verification update process by running `!ck verify` again."

Stats:
  Info:
    About: |-
      Below you'll find information on what's considered a statistic by Kiera:

      This Server Has Stats: `{{serverState}}`
      Your Stats are Currently: `{{userState}}`
      Your Stats Entries (From all servers): `{{count}}`

      **These statistics consist of:**
        - Date & Time
        - Server ID
        - Channel ID
        - User ID
        - Type of statistic (Action seen, Example: Message, Server Join, Reaction, Name of Command used, etc)
        - If its a Kiera command it will contain only the command name & the success state

      **These Statistics do not contain:**
        - Message body (nothing that's contained within the message body, Text, Image, URL, etc)
        - Message ID
        - The outcome body of any commands
        - User or Nicknames
        - Anything in DMs where Kiera is not present

      **About Disabling Statistics:**
        - At the User level: None of these stats will be recorded (inc: Server or Channel)
        - At the Channel level: No stats on the channel or users will be recorded within that channel
        - At the Server level: No stats recorded on the server (inc: Channel or User)

  Channel:
    Disabled: |-
      All stats have now been **Disabled** for this channel.

      - If you wish to delete all recorded stats to date you can run the following command `{{prefix}}stats delete channel`.
      - Disabling alone stops new logging going forward only.
      - When channel statistics are disabled but not deleted they may still appear on Server or User statistics.
      - The `{{prefix}}stats channel` command will now be disabled for this channel.

      For more information about Statistics, see the `{{prefix}}stats about` command output.
