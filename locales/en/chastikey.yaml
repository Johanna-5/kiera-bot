      There seems to be an error finding this user's stats (`{{user}}`), here are some common issues:
      - Has not opened (ChastiKey) the App in >=2 week, if this is the case the app will need to be opened & wait ~15-30 minutes for the stats to refresh.
      - The user does not participate in locking.

      Scan this code with the ChastiKey App like loading a lock (within the next 5 minutes), this will verify your Discord Account to ChastiKey.
      If your ChastiKey account is new in the last 15-30 minutes, it may take this long for Kiera to receive all the required data.

    FastForward: "Your account has been verified! Some data may still take **up to 15 minutes** to be cached and fully accessable."
    PreviouslyCompleted: "Your account has already been verified! If there are any issues with this please reachout to @emma#1366"
    VerifyReq2: |-
      This command requires your account be verified with ChastiKey using the following command: 
      `!ck verify`\n\nIf you just did this in the last 15 minutes or less, you can speed up some of the verification update process by running `!ck verify` again."
